in a case where i have multiple items and i need to click on each before taking a screenshot
Hi, in that case, it is probably better to use the scripts option.
scripts=<any JavaScript code>
can i use it programatically via my n8n workflow i am considering getting my company to suscribe
We have a community node now:

https://github.com/screenshotone/n8n-nodes-screenshotone

But if you are on the cloud you can send HTTP requests, probably, like to a regular API.
https://app.markup.io/markup/bb3022bd-01f0-4ed5-8fbb-1c5da2e3bdc7
the above is a sample markup link where we need to programatically get screenshot of each item with their annotation . to screenshot the remaining items we need to to be able to switch images . This is a key bottle neck at the moment as it is not possible to do so
Each item from the right sidebar?
Are you able to integrate with JavaScript by writing code?
Or n8n only?
i think we could have a code node in n8n
And you need the screenshot of the whole screen, but with different items clicked on the sidebar?

Do you know these items beforehand? Before screenshotting or how many of them are there?
yes. we would know the number of items before hand and their image pathnames
Oh, then it might be possible.

Try to find a selector for one of the items and use the click option for the screenshot. With the selector, e.g. in the playground.

If that works, I think it is safe to assume you can fully automate it.
there is also a next selectore on the page maybe i could use that and keep clicking till there is no more images. and the take screenshot after each click. is this possible with your api

A bit problematic, since for every screenshot, it will be again starting from the page 1 and clicking on the next.
Going with sidebar selector
Or something that could click on the images, would be a better optiob.
*option
okay. I will try something around this and get back to you
thank you for the help
