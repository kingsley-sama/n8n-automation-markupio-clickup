i set up the http nodes to connect to markup.io
I explored the possible approaches when it comes to setting up a workflow for the image.
    while selenium could work. it is not quite assured due to it's requiring browser using  
    other tools I discovered where puppeteer 
    and i got 2 platforms which were getscreenshot and screenshot.io they both provide apis for taking screenshot of webs pages
    and i was able to get a demo. but then there are other constraints also being that in a case where there are multiple images on the page 
    we need to deal with the software manually clicking to reveal the next image. but if there is possibility for for that which there might be because i was in talks with their support as to what is possible with their api and he gave me a good amount of informations
    another aproach i will explore is to use a script coupled with a webscrapper like selenium and maybe manually plot the points on the image bite using a stable tool like canvas. this seems most stable
    but would require code and also
