make an issue log for the pms for them to log issues they have while using my automation
how do the suppliers understand the comments just to understand that everything is good and if something is not clear
look for trigger words and the we can double check
send scheduled email when work in progress
maybe send initial email and after project accepted and send a second cofirmation
Mind Mapxmind



Have a database for loggin messages sent:
- Project name as unique idetifier
- time added 
- status
- client email
- 
Maybe have a cron job for sening messag:

Have clickup task and bug reports sheets in those tasks we are working 
for the bug report we could use a mind map and it might take time 
have all the workflow task in clickup and have a structure for that (some task are big and some tasks are small)
